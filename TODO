# TODO

- Port over the week session usage rate; this is cool
- Work on the onboarding screen bugs
- Can the integration info view show my anthropic account name? so if i have two accounts logged in / two instances of the integration. Will require exploration of api.
- Figure out recommended git tagging / GitHub release strategy so consumers of this don't have to add git master to their HACS installs. Don't use semver; just do major version numbers.
- Put screenshots in README to explain what this is.
- Make an icon!
